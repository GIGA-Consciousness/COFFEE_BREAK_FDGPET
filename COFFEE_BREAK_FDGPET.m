%Authors: Arianna Sala (ULIEGE, CHU), Andreas Schindele (Universit√§tsklinikum Augsburg) 
%Contributors: Claire Bernard (CHU Liege; SUV_computation); Chris Rordern (USC; nii_setOriginCOM)

%The script allows to obtain with a single click and starting from the patient's original DICOM images 
%(i) an estimate of the average reduction of the patient's brain GM metabolism; 
%(ii) single-subject maps of relative hypometabolism vs. preserved metabolism; 
%(iii) a standardized report on the topography of hypometabolism and preserved metabolism at regional and network level.

%SETUP:

%0) DOWNLOAD THE SCRIPT FOLDER FROM THE Y ON YOUR COMPUTER

%1) CHANGE DIRECTORY TO THE SCRIPT FOLDER AND TYPE 'COFFEE_BREAK_FDG" IN
%THE COMMAND PROMPT; PRESS ENTER

%THE SCRIPT WILL JUST ASK YOU TO SELECT THE FOLDER WITH THE DICOM FILES.
%ONLY DICOM FILES MUST BE IN THE FOLDER, NOTHING ELSE!

%BEFORE LOOKING AT THE RESULTS, ALWAYS CHECK THE INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT FILES TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING
%WENT WRONG!!! 

%SEE THE INTRODUCTORY SLIDES FOR MORE INFO!
