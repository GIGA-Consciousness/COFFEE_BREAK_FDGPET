
%COFFE_BREAK_FDGPET SCRIPT TO DERIVE SINGLE SUBJECT FDG_PET RESULTS IN THE CLINICS
%Authors: Arianna Sala (ULIEGE, CHU), Andreas Schindele (UniversitÃ¤tsklinikum Augsburg) 
%Contributors: Claire Bernard (CHU Liege; SUV_computation); Chris Rordern (USC; nii_setOriginCOM)

%The script allows to obtain with a single click and starting from the patient's original DICOM images 
%(i) an estimate of the average reduction of the patient's brain GM metabolism; 
%(ii) single-subject maps of relative hypometabolism vs. preserved metabolism; 
%(iii) a standardized report on the topography of hypometabolism and preserved metabolism at regional and network level.

%SETUP:

%0) DOWNLOAD THE SCRIPT FOLDER FROM THE Y ON YOUR COMPUTER

%1) THE DIRECTORY "SCRIPT" WITHIN THE COFFEE_BREAK_FDGPET FOLDER  NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE MATLAB
%PATH. CLICK HOME>SET PATH>ADD WITH SUBFOLDERS, THEN SELECT THE SCRIPT FOLDER ON YOUR COMPUTER

%DONE!!! NOW THE SCRIPT IS READY TO RUN. FROM NOW ON YOU WILL JUST HAVE TO TYPEE COFFE_BREAK_FDGPET AND
%PRESS ENTER IN MATLAB EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO RUN THE SCRIPT. 

%THE SCRIPT WILL JUST ASK YOU TO SELECT THE FOLDER WITH THE DICOM FILES.
%ONLY DICOM FILES MUST BE IN THE FOLDER, NOTHING ELSE!

%BEFORE LOOKING AT THE RESULTS, ALWAYS CHECK THE INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT FILES TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING
%WENT WRONG!!! 

%SEE THE INTRODUCTORY SLIDES FOR MORE INFO!
