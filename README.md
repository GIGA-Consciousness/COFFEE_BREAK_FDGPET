# FDG\_PET\_COFFEEBREAK

Coffee break script to optimize FDG-PET analyses in disorders of consciousness.

Together with the downloading all files and folders in these repository, 
the nifti files of 33HC have to be added to the MASK\_TEMPLATES\_HC folder
for the script to run. 
These files can be downloaded from:
[ebrains.eu](https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/live/minds/core/dataset/v1.0.0/68a61eab-7ba9-47cf-be78-b9addd64bb2f)

Please note that the script should be run by experienced users
and quality checks should be performed afterwards;
please refer to the material available here for more information: 
[FDG-PET-2021](https://indico.giga.uliege.be/e/FDG-PET-2021)

Note: this is a preliminary version of the script that still has to be
extensively tested on different scanners.
