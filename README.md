# FDG_PET_COFFEEBREAK

Coffee break script to optimize FDG-PET analyses in disorders of consciousness.

Together with the uploaded folders and script, the nifti files of 33HC have to be added to the MASK_TEMPLATES_HC for the script to run. 
These files can be downloaded from: https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/live/minds/core/dataset/v1.0.0/68a61eab-7ba9-47cf-be78-b9addd64bb2f

Please note that the script should be run by experienced users and quality checks should be performed after the script has run; please refer to the material available here for more information: https://indico.giga.uliege.be/e/FDG-PET-2021
